# transcript-reader
Reads a transcript from UWaterloo and prints average grade in given courses and given course numbers.

Ex: when prompted, if the user inputs subjects "CS" and "Stat", lower bound = "300", 
and upper bound = "499", you'll get your average grade in all 3rd and 4th year CS and Stat courses.

All you have to do is download your transcript and move it somewhere in the directory of this project (preferrably in ./data).
